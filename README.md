# 42-Piscine
This is the code I wrote during 42 Piscine, a month-long coding camp. All exercises are written in C and Shell.

About 42:
42 is a future-proof computer science training to educate the next generation of software engineers. The 42 program takes a project-based approach to progress and is designed to develop technical and people skills that match the expectations of the labor market. No courses. No teachers.

About the piscine:
For one month, the Piscine at 42 lets you tackle the teaching methods of the school: peer-to-peer learning, group work, peer-evaluation and project pedagogy. Immersion. Dive into the work methods of the students of 42. Intensive learning. A month dedicated to stepping into programming for good.
